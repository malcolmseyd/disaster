# Disaster

This is a VSCode extension for disassembling C and C++ code. Simply run the command and an object file will be compiled, dissassembled, and the relevant code will be scrolled to.

## Requirements

This extension requires `objdump` to be installed on your machine. As far as I'm aware, only Linux and the BSDs have this tool.

## Extension Settings

// TODO stuff related to Make, CMake, and objdump
